\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Significance of this Document}
This document would act as an input to the design phase of the project.
The purpose of this document is to serve the project in terms of specifying
the requirements of the project clearly. The needs of the project, scope
and various functional and non-functional requirements are described in
detail to ensure that the design phase is carried out with ease and with
clear understanding of the concepts involved.

\subsection{Target Audience for this Document}
This document is intended for developers, testers, and documentation writers.
The reader must go through System Specific Requirements and other non-functional requirements for detailed study of features proposed to be incorporated in the project.

\subsection{Product Scope}
This project has very wide scope, mainly because there are very few
constraints. Any user, who has internet access and is socially active, can
use this product. Also, the fact that social networking platforms are used
all around the globe, the people who belong to the above defined set are
from every corner of the world and thus, the scope of this project covers
a wide range of users.

\subsection{Overview}
The requirement specification captures system requirements for the
following areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functionality
    \item Usability
    \item Reliability
    \item Performance
    \item Supportability
    \item Design Constraints
 
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{What is the Problem?}
The origin of this idea is the fact that, most of the people have accounts
on multiple social networking platforms and, they prioritise the events
happening on most of these platforms. Thus, to remain updated on
their PCs or laptops, the person needs to open these websites, refresh
them again and again, go to the notification panel and scroll through the
notifications. Also suppose, if someone wants to get updates from three
of the social medias, then he will have to open all the three in different
tabs of the browser.

\subsection{Product functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notifications of all the logged in accounts on the new tab page of
the browser, sorted and arranged according to its domain.
 
    \item   Providing a “GOTO” button on the bottom of each card to redirect
the user to the respective social networking platform.
 
    \item Providing an “Add” option, to add new cards that will refer to
other social networking accounts. 

\item Providing a “Remove” option, on each card that will remove that
card from the preferences of the user.
\item Providing an option to click on the new tab button (Ctrl + T), and
use the features of the extension.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target Audience for the Project}
The target audience for this project are all the socially active
individuals throughout the globe, who use different kind of social
networking platforms Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Github, etc.

\subsection{Operating Environment}
Software environment:

    \subsubsection{Current}
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Google Chrome Extension
    \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection{Future}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Firefox Add-on
    \item Desktop App
    \end{itemize}
    


\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
The assumption made here is that, the users use social networking platforms and appreciate remaining updated with their social lives. The user have moderate knowledge of using Internet and
is familiar with using Web Applications.

\subsection{User Documentation}
A short video tutorial will be provided for getting to know the functionality of the system. Apart from this, we also plan to make the user manual available using ReadTheDocs, a VCS enabled documentation generation system. It will allow us to generate documentations in multiple formats on the fly; the formats themselves being PDF, EPUB, Kindle (MOBI), web-based etc.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Our project would be constrained under certain circumstances. These
include:
\begin{itemize}

    \item Designing a lightweight UI, so that the extension works properly.


    \item Material design will be used in UI designing.
    \item Team skills.
    \end{itemize}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interface}
Following requirements have been gathered regarding the
interface level design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The extension should be user friendly. The front-end
part should not be overpopulated with unnecessary
stuff.
    \item For the web app, we will be following material design
conventions.
    \item If an event occurs, the user should be guided with a
message dialog box displaying either the event is successful or an error has occurred.
    \item Flexibility to adjust size of each card in such a
manner that even if there is a single card or there
are multiple cards they all must be visible on the
screen.
    \item Providing a {"}GOTO{"} button on the bottom of each card to redirect
the user to the respective social networking platform. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Interface}
This will be a Chrome Extension so, any hardware which
can run the PC version of Google Chrome above 38.0.0 and
have an internet connection, will be able to run this
extension. In theory the extension will be able to run by all
other devices that can emulate the PC version of Google
Chrome above 38.0.0

\subsection{Software Interface}
The framework designed to fetch data from the web servers of social networking platform and displaying the content in extension in browser acts as an interface designed in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The framework will use user credentials to generate Auth Token.

\subsection{ Communications Interfaces}
This will be a Chrome extension, but may still link to web
pages. This will be communicating with database server, so
will be making use of the respective social network
database and connecting it to the extension. The primary
forms of communication will be database queries or
requests. The system will need to integrate the extension
for secure login of the different social networks. The
application will need to be synchronized, so that the
information displayed to the user is always up to date.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\end{itemize}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Satisfaction:} The application must be such
that it stands up to the user expectations.
    \item \textbf{Response Time:} The response of all the operation
should be good.
    \item \textbf{Error Handling:} Response to user errors and
undesired situations has been taken care of to
ensure that the application operates without any
uncertainty.
    \item \textbf{User friendliness: }The application is easy to learn
and understand. A naive user can also use the system effectively,
without any difficulties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reliability}
The extension is capable to maintain the specified level of
performance. It will run on all PC version of Google Chrome
above 38.0.0. (Version to be taken care). It’ll be reliable and authenticated by Google.

\subsection{Availability}
Ours is a web based application so generally it will only work if one is connected to the Internet. This will work for Browser extension. The extension will run 24*7 if the internet connection is
available and if Google Chrome is open.

\subsection{Portability}
Since, we are making a Chrome extension. This can be easily used on any operating system like windows, linux, mac os, which support PC version of Google Chrome.

\subsection{Safety Requirement}
As such, there are no safety requirements with this
product, other than any normal hazards of a PC or laptop.
The only hazard is the user using their PCs or laptops for a
long time, which they should not do, as this can affect their
eyesight and other health issues.

\subsection{Security Requirement}
The software should provide a secure login to every
individual user to every single social network, as the user is
providing his/her account’s credentials.
Additionally, the server side is to be regularly maintained
and saved by the malicious attacks. Talking about the physical
security options, the user should himself/herself take care that
no other user uses his/her login account and extract their
personal data.

\subsection{Business Rules}
\subsubsection{User Role}
The user should feel responsible for securing his/her login account from other users.
\subsubsection{Developer Role}
The developer should understand his/her role in creating the application which should not exploit the rights of individuals and should design the software according to these needs of the user and not for any unrelated issues. It’s his duty to understand that the kind of information and the data that is to be associated with the application is important to the users and it must be trusted at the same time.

\section{System Requirement Gathering}
The procedure, we followed to gather system requirements was the survey
through Google Forms. The survey was designed in such a manner that we can
get response from every sector. This helped us greatly in deciding what features
should we implement, what the system should be capable of and, where to
implement them. The survey statistics are discussed in this section.
We have taken the survey which includes the following questions. There were
total of 94 responses for these questions.\\
